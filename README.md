# Book Selector Application

This is a React-based web application for selecting school book packages.

## Setup and Running

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    This project uses `react`, `react-dom`, and `react-router-dom`. If you are setting this up in a new project, you'll need to install them.
    ```bash
    npm install react react-dom react-router-dom
    npm install --save-dev @types/react @types/react-dom
    ```

2.  **Environment Variables:**
    This project simulates environment variables. In a real-world scenario, you would create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`. For this version, constants are defined in `src/constants.ts`.

3.  **Run the development server:**
    Use a development server like Vite or Create React App to run the project.
    ```bash
    # Example using Vite
    npm run dev
    ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port depending on your setup).
